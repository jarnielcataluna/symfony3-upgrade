# Upgrade Outdated Libraries!

If you did you homework, then by now, you've gone through your entire site and updated
your code to remove all of the deprecation warnings.

## Upgrading Offending Libraries/Bundles!

*Except* for the ones that you *can't* fix, because they're not coming from your code.
It's pretty likely that you have a group of external libraries and bundles that are
*also* causing deprecation warnings.

In our app, we have this exact problem, with AsseticBundle. So before we upgrade
to Symfony 3, we need to upgrade to a new version of that library that does *not*
use old code.

No problem! Google for AsseticBundle. I'll click into the link on [Packagist][1].
I'm looking here to find the latest released version of Packagist, which right now,
is 2.8.0. If we update to that, those deprecation warnings will *hopefully* go away.

Open up `composer.json`:

[[[ code('9a7bfac68e') ]]]

Our version is `~2.6`, but my PhpStorm Composer plugin tells me that we actually
have 2.7.1. Let's require 2.8.0 by changing this to `^2.8`:

[[[ code('a38321a983') ]]]

The `^` symbol is the new hipster way to describe your version constraints - it basically
allows 2.8 and higher, but not some future 3.0 version of AsseticBundle.

Next, copy the library name - `symfony/assetic-bundle`. Since we *only* want to
upgrade this library right now, find your terminal and run:

```bash
composer update symfony/assetic-bundle
```

### What Version to Choose?

In general, if a library is giving you deprecation warnings like this one, you *do*
need to upgrade it, but you may *not* need to upgrade it to the absolute latest
version. If you want to be a bit more conservative, you can dig into the release
notes of a library to find the *first* version number that is Symfony 3 compatible.
It's more work, but might mean less QA time than upgrading a library many versions
all at once.

Hello AsseticBundle 2.8.0! Oh, and see those messages from Composer? That's another
usage of deprecations in action: some of our code is using some deprecated functionality
in Composer itself. Those will probably go away when we upgrade Symfony. But, either
way, it's not important right now.

Let's check in on our deprecations: refresh the page. Yes! 33 deprecations down to
*one*. And don't worry about that last deprecation - it's really specific to this
project - so I'm not going to take time to fix it.

Ok, we've now upgraded all outside libraries that were not Symfony 3 compatible
and our deprecation warnings are gone. We are ready.
